# Research Notes: Forecasting Methods for Forex Trading

## Current Implementation Analysis
The current forex trading system uses:
- EGARCH models for volatility calculation
- State identification (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral) based on volatility thresholds and log returns
- Position sizing based on state identification
- No sophisticated filtering mechanism for profitable trading opportunities

## Machine Learning Approaches for Forex Forecasting

### Deep Learning Models
1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Good for sequential data like time series
   - Can capture temporal dependencies in forex data
   - Limited memory for long sequences

2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
   - Extension of RNNs with better memory capabilities
   - Can capture long-term dependencies in forex data
   - Most commonly used for forex market prediction according to research
   - Can be combined with existing EGARCH models

3. **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)**
   - Similar to LSTM but with simpler architecture
   - Comparable performance to LSTM with fewer parameters
   - Demonstrated superior accuracy in forex volatility prediction

### Ensemble Methods
1. **Random Forests**
   - Can predict performance of volatility-based trading strategies
   - Works well with mixed feature types (technical indicators, volatility measures, state data)
   - Provides feature importance which helps in understanding key drivers

### Complexity Measures as Features
1. **Hurst Exponent**
   - Measures the long-term memory of a time series
   - Can identify trending vs mean-reverting behavior
   - Enhances accuracy of deep learning models for volatility prediction

2. **Fuzzy Entropy**
   - Measures the complexity and irregularity of time series
   - Can identify regime changes in market behavior
   - Improves forecasting accuracy when combined with traditional features

### Alternative Data Sources
1. **Financial News**
   - Features extracted from news can improve prediction performance
   - Can be used to anticipate market reactions to events
   - Requires NLP techniques for feature extraction

## Filtering Approaches for Profitable Trading

### Probability-Based Filtering
1. **Calibrated Probability Models**
   - Use machine learning to estimate probability of profitable trades
   - Set threshold for trade execution based on probability
   - Can significantly reduce unprofitable trades

### Hybrid Approaches
1. **Combining EGARCH with Machine Learning**
   - Use EGARCH for volatility forecasting
   - Use ML to filter trades based on additional factors
   - Leverage existing state identification (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral)

2. **Multi-Factor Models**
   - Combine state, volatility, and additional technical indicators
   - Use ML to learn optimal weighting of factors
   - Filter trades based on combined score

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Leverage existing state and volatility data
   - Add technical indicators as additional features
   - Consider market regime features (trending vs ranging)

2. **Model Selection**
   - LSTM/GRU for time series forecasting
   - Random Forest for classification of profitable trades
   - Ensemble approach combining multiple models

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy of profitability prediction
   - Reduction in unprofitable trades
   - Overall improvement in risk-adjusted returns

## Next Steps
1. Design a filtering mechanism that integrates with the existing codebase
2. Implement feature engineering to prepare data for ML models
3. Develop and train ML models for profitability prediction
4. Integrate the filtering mechanism with the trading strategy
5. Test and evaluate the solution on historical data
